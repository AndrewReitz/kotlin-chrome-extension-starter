= Kotlin Chrome Extension Starter

Project template to get you started writing chrome extensions in Kotlin.

== Usage

Clone the project or download the source files as a zip. Then rename the project in settings.gradle.kts,
change the group and version in build.gradle.kts to what you want. Then in the expand block for the
manifest.json add the extension name and description. Finally customize to your desire. This only provides the backend
script but following what's in the project adding more content shouldn't be to bad.

To test run `gradlew installDist` then point the extension to the folder in `build/install`.

To deploy run `gradlew distZip` and upload the zip file located in `build/distributions` to the chrome store.

== FAQ

Q: Couldn't this be a a lazybones project?
A: Yes, and it it gets enough use I'll consider converting it.
